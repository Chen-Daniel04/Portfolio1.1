Setup and Usage
To set up and run this portfolio locally, you'll need to set up both the React frontend and connect to your Sanity.io project.
1. Frontend Setup (React)
1.	Clone the repository: 
Bash
git clone https://github.com/Chen-Daniel04/Portfolio1.1.git
2.	Navigate to the project directory: 
Bash
cd Portfolio1.1
3.	Install dependencies: 
Bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
4.	Create a .env file: In the root of your project, create a file named .env and add your Sanity project details: 
5.	REACT_APP_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_sanity_project_id
6.	REACT_APP_SANITY_DATASET=your_sanity_dataset_name # e.g., 'production'
7.	REACT_APP_SANITY_API_VERSION=2021-03-25 # or current date
(Replace your_sanity_project_id and your_sanity_dataset_name with your actual Sanity credentials.)
8.	Start the development server: 
Bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
This will open the application in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.
2. Backend Setup (Sanity.io)
This project assumes you have a Sanity.io project set up with appropriate schemas for your portfolio content (e.g., project, skill, about).
1.	Initialize Sanity Project: If you haven't already, set up a Sanity project. Refer to the Sanity documentation for detailed instructions.
2.	Define Schemas: Ensure your Sanity project has schemas defined for your portfolio content (e.g., projects, skills, about me). These schemas should match how your React frontend expects to consume the data.
3.	Populate Content: Add your portfolio data (projects, skills, about information) using the Sanity Studio.

Customization
If you plan to fork and customize this portfolio for your own use, here are some key areas you'll want to modify:
•	React Components: Update the content, project details, and personal information within the React components (e.g., src/components/About.jsx, src/components/Projects.jsx).
•	Sanity Schemas: Adjust your Sanity schemas (schemas folder in your Sanity studio project) to fit any new content types or fields you wish to include.
•	Styling: Modify the CSS files (e.g., src/App.css, src/index.css or individual component CSS) to adjust the styling, colors, and layout.
•	Images: Replace the placeholder images with your own project screenshots and profile picture.
•	Sanity Content: Update all your portfolio content directly within your Sanity Studio.
